  	<h2>Course Contract:</h2>
    <p>
I, <strong>Jason Towne</strong>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024 Web140-N801: Web Development Tools with my instructor, Professor Ella McManus. <br>
I understand that all work that I do on my website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. <br>
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Workspace Setup</h2>

Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. <br>
Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.
